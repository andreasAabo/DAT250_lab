<h3> Technical problems </h3>

In this experiment i had sevreal problems.

The first problem i encountered was when i tried to import the project into Intellij. I knew that would be using eclipselink, but hoped maven installed all the needed tools for me. I did not manage to get the project running as expected when launching it from Intellij. To resolve this I ended up just importing the project into eclipse, where everything worked as expected from the start.
