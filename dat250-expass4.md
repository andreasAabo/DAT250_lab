<h3> Technical problems </h3>

I implemented everything with a simple mapping to a HashMap. Now my post, and get (getAll) function works as expected. But my functions specifying id (/todos/:id) just donâ€™t seem to work when I am sending request from postman. The request will have (put/delete/get) and for example this url: ```http://localhost:8080/todos?id=1``` for id = 1. No matter what I tried the functions containing: /todos/:id, just would not get accessed with postman calls. I concluded this might be due to the simple mapping used to solve this task. I believe the functions is implemented correctly, I just can't access them when calling from postman.
