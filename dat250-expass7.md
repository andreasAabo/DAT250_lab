<h3> Technical problems </h3>

I did not really have any technical issues, but I realized some of the code needed to run the code in experiment 2 where not given in the tutorial itself. This was easy to solve since the tutorial had several points where I could check for code differences ("View the full code at this point"). This made it easy to just copy in parts my code was missing, like ReactDom.render() and the div structure inside the render function in the Board class.
