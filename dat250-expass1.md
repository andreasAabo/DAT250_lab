<h3> Technical problems </h3>

I did not have any problems during the installation of the software development enviroment. However I made the assumption that Maven was already installed on my computer, since I have prevosly worked with Maven in Intellij. I Still checked that Maven was installed with the command, ´´´mvn --version´´´ where the command mvn was not recognised, meaning Maven was not installed. Turns out intellij has built in maven support. From there I installed Maven and added the right enviroment-variables (MAVEN_HOME and M2_HOME) and system path. This avoided any technical issues related to Maven when working with the Heroku platform.

<h3> Validated that the software development environment is working </h3>

To validate that software development environment is working I just ran these commands in the cmd:

```mvn --version```
```git --version```
